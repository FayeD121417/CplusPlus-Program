# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a program to allow Chada Tech's domestic and international clients that would show a 12 and 24 hour clock on their website that meets international standard ISO 8601.

# What did you do particularly well?
I planned the execution of the code well but struggled to make it work correctly.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance all of the code.  I never successfully made this project work.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
In this project, as well as all my other projects, I struggled to get the compiler to work correctly in Visual Studio.  I have utilized YouTube videos on C++ to my support network to try and get a better grasp on C++.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning these basics helped me with other projects and coursework.  

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to make sure it was readable, but never successfully got it to work the way it is supposed to work.
